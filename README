Repository Root:
	conf	- configuration files for installation
	awstats	- web statistics
	backup  - the place to store backups
	db	- database directory (not really used right now)
	log	- logs for everything
		\ raw -> raw logs
	htdocs	- main static web content
	var	- root for user uploaded data
	forum	- forum system (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ files -> var/forum/files (uploaded content)
	photos	- photos service (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ albums -> var/photos/albums (uploaded content)
	wiki	- wiki system (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ images -> var/wiki/images (uploaded content)

HINTS:

(1) For dynamic content, don't put in htdocs.
    Please create a seperate directory, like 'wiki' 'photos'.
(2) If you want to enable uploading, don't put directory into SVN.
    Just create directory on real server as a symbolic link
    to ~moztw/var/XXX/YYY where XXX/YYY presents your original directory
