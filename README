Mozilla Taiwan Web Repository Layout

Repository Structure:
	conf	- configuration files for installation
	awstats	- web statistics
	htdocs	- main static web content
		\ inc/README.txt (webpage guide, please read this first)
		\ dls/ -> var/htdocs/dls
		\ awstats/ -> /awstats/SITENAME
	forum	- forum system (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ files -> var/forum/files (uploaded content)
	photos	- photos service (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ albums -> var/photos/albums (uploaded content)
	wiki	- wiki system (PHP+MySQL dynamic content)
		\ images -> var/wiki/images (uploaded content)

	[ directories that you should create but not in repository: ]
	var	- root for user uploaded data (chown -R www:www var)
	backup  - the place to store backups
	db	- database directory (if you want to put mysql inside)
	log	- logs for everything
		\ raw -> raw logs

HINTS:

(1) For dynamic content, don't put in htdocs.
    Please create a seperate directory, like 'wiki' 'photos'.
(2) If you want to enable uploading, don't put directory into SVN.
    Just create directory on real server as a symbolic link
    to ~moztw/var/XXX/YYY where XXX/YYY presents your original directory
(3) To create a new site module (like wiki, photo, forum...)
    please contact site admin first. Please use database account as
    userid="web" and pw="" (empty), this is a localhost only account.
(4) lighttpd does not support .htaccess.
    If you are installing some module with that, notify site admin to
    change lightttpd configuration.
